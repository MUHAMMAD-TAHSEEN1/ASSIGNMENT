      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.
      It uses tags—like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>—to tell browsers how
      to display headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other elements. HTML provides the skeleton of a webpage,
      while CSS controls presentation (colors, layout, fonts) and JavaScript adds interactivity.

      Learning HTML is the first step for anyone who wants to build websites. It is simple to start with,
      widely supported, and forms the foundation for modern web development. With just a few tags you can
      create accessible, well-structured pages that work across devices.
